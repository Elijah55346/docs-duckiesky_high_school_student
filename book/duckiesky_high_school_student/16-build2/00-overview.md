# Build: 2 {#part:build2 status=ready}

In this part of the build, you will be adding your first sensor to the drone -- the infrared (IR) sensor. The IR sensor is used to measure distance, and it is used on the drone to measure how high it is flying. By the end of this build part, you will be able to see the output of the infrared sensor in a web browser using the drone's web interface!

Build Part 2 Instructions can be found in the [Operations Manual](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_sky/opmanual_sky/out/build_part2_overview.html)
