# Localization {#part:localization status=ready}

This section introduces robot localization: the process of determining where a robot is in a pre-defined map. The content and instructions in this section will teach you how to create a map for your drone to fly over, and how to command your drone to fly to specific positions in your map. For the drone, a "map" is simply a photograph of the surface that your drone flies over.
