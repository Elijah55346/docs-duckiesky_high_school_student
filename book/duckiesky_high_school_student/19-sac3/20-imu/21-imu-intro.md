# Intro to the IMU {#sac3-imu-intro status=ready}


## Applications

IMUs have many applications. Even cars use IMUs to measure the acceleration to determine when it is time to deploy the airbags. Some computer hard drives use IMUs to detect if the hard drive is falling, and [turn off to protect the data before the crash occurs](https://www.sparkfun.com/pages/accel_gyro_guide). The IMU that is used on your drone originated in a gaming console used to detect hand motions-- can you guess which one? The answer is the Nintendo Wii remote, and the IMU is the sensor that allows you to swing a tennis racket, or get a strike in virtual bowling.
