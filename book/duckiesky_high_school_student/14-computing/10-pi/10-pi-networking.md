    - The 7 layers of abstraction is 
    - Use HTTP and inspect the element
        - Netcat wont work through the drone in the lesson that was made

TODO: Input details based 7 layers of abstraction.



- To connect the Pi, follow the [Build Part 1 Checkpoint Instructions](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_sky/out/build_part1_checkpoint.html) from the Operations Manual
    - The text editor on this screen is Visual Studio Code (VSCode). This
