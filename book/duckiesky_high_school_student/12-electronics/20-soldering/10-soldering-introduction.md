# Intro to Soldering {#electronics-soldering-introduction status=ready}

To put the drone together, wires have to be connected to each other, to sensors, and other electrical components. To do this, connections are formed by heating and cooling the mallieable metal known as solder. The soldering iron is the tool to heat the solder. Remeber, solder can get very hot and fling out. It is necessary to have eye protection, as well as to not breathe in soldering fumes. To make the soldering of two wires together easier, use helping hands or long-nose pliers. Tinning is what you do before you solder, which is coating a metal with solder to help it join and flow electricity better to another wire. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRPF4wpXX9Q) that shows how to properly tin a wire. 

Here's a step by step on how to tin a wire:

1. Twist the loose wire ends into a tight twist
2. Hold the wire stably in place with helping hands or a plier.
3. Apply a solder dot onto the iron (to increase heat transfer from the iron to the wire)
4. Apply the iron onto the wire about to be tinned. Wait a few seconds for the wire to heat up.
5. Apply the solder onto the wire NOT THE IRON , and let the solder melt and flow into and on the wire.
6. Wipe away any excess solder with the iron being careful to not fling it too aggressively so to avoid burning someone/something.
7. Remove the iron and clean it
8. Let the wire cool.
