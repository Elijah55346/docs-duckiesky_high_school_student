- AI (Artificial Intelligence)
    - Artificial intelligence allows systems to gain the potential to accomplish tasks that usually requires the intelligence of humans or decision making skills.
    
- Branch
    - A [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes.

- Bystander Effect:
    - The bystander effect describes a phenomem where the more people that are present, the less likely someone will help a victim during a situation. Be wary of this, make sure that if there is a dangerous situation, be cautious and aware, and take action to help those who need it.

- Cloning
    - A [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected to the remote version so that you can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.

- Closed source code
    - when the source code cannot be accessed by others, or it remains classified, only seen by those who are authorized to.

- DuckieSky
    - [DuckieSky](https://sites.brown.edu/duckiesky/) is a program within Duckietown lead by Professor Stefanie Tellex that develops and manages the MOOC-based drone curriculum in this book and that distributes drone kits to high schools throughout Rhode Island.
- Duckietown Foundation
    - [The Duckietown Foundation](https://www.duckietown.org/about/duckietown-foundation) is the non-profit foundation that develops and promotes the Duckietown project, which explores autonomous robot platforms. You can read more about Duckietown.

- DL (Deep Learning)
    - Deep Learning is a portion of AI that replicates the human brain by processing data involved with object and speech recognition, and making decisions (Investopedia).

- Ethics

- Fork
    - A [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected.
- Git
    - [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is an open-source program for tracking changes in text files.

    - [HTML](https://techterms.com/definition/html) [Hypertext Markup Language) is a programming language used to create webpages.
- Issue
    - An [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is a suggested improvement, task or question related to the repository. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators.

- Kill Switch
    - The kill switch on the drone is the spacebar on the keyboard which immediately disarms the drone after they have begun flying it. If something goes wrong during flight, press the spacebar.

- ML (Machine Learning)
    - Machine Learning is a portion of AI that lets systems learn and improve from their experiences without programming it into the system.

    - [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.
- Markduck
    - [Markduck](https://docs.duckietown.org/DT19/duckumentation/out/markduck_basic.html) is a Markdown dialect that supports many Markdown features. It is the language that the majority of the Duckiesky High School Textbook [including this document) was written in.

- NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board)
    - US investigative body for vehicle/transportation accidents.

- Open source code:
     - when the source code can be accessible by the public.

- Open-sourced Project
    - An [open-sourced project](https://github.com/open-source) is a project where the code used to make a particular program or application is available to everyone.

- Pull Request
    - A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is a proposed change to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators.
