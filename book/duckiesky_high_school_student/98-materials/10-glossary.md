# Glossary {#materials-glossary status=ready}

This glossary contains an alphanumerically ordered list of terms utilized in this text book. Each word or phrase is linked to a page where you can learn more about the definition of the term.

- Branch
    - A [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes.
- Cloning
    - A [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected to the remote version so that you can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.
- DuckieSky
    - [DuckieSky](https://sites.brown.edu/duckiesky/) is a program within Duckietown lead by Professor Stefanie Tellex that develops and manages the MOOC-based drone curriculum in this book and that distributes drone kits to high schools throughout Rhode Island.
- Duckietown Foundation
    - [The Duckietown Foundation](https://www.duckietown.org/about/duckietown-foundation) is the non-profit foundation that develops and promotes the Duckietown project, which explores autonomous robot platforms. You can read more about Duckietown.
- Fork
    - A [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected.
- Git
    - [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is an open-source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of. 
- GitHub
    - [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is a Git repository hosting service, or an online datastructure that is a basis for storing and presenting these code projects.
- HTML
    - [HTML](https://techterms.com/definition/html) [Hypertext Markup Language) is a programming language used to create webpages.
- Issue
    - An [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is a suggested improvement, task or question related to the repository. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators.
- Markdown
    - [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.
- Markduck
    - [Markduck](https://docs.duckietown.org/DT19/duckumentation/out/markduck_basic.html) is a Markdown dialect that supports many Markdown features. It is the language that the majority of the Duckiesky High School Textbook [including this document) was written in.
- Open-sourced Project
    - An [open-sourced project](https://github.com/open-source) is a project where the code used to make a particular program or application is available to everyone.
- Pull Request
    - A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is a proposed change to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. 
- Repository
    - A [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files [including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
- Syntax
    - [Syntax](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3959/syntax) refers to the rules that specify the correct combined sequence of symbols that can be used to form a correctly structured program using a given programming language.
- Version Control Systems 
    - [Version control systems](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) are software programs that allow programmers and code-based project workers to manage the changes to their code-based projects over time with new versions.
