# Sensing {#subpart:sac2-sensing status=ready}

Your drone needs to know how high it is above the ground if it wants to fly at a constant height. This subsection will get you a giant step closer to making this possible. The lessons in this subsection will walk through the processes of:

1. understanding the output of the infrared sensor

1. converting the output into a useful unit, such as meters which are used to measure distance

1. writing a Python program to read the sensor using the Raspberry Pi

By the end of this subsection, you will be able to measure distances with your IR sensor!
