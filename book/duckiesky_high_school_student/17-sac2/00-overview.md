# Sensors, Actuators, and Control: 2 {#part:sac2 status=ready}

This section demonstrates how to use the infrared sensor that you attached to your drone in Build Part 2. The first subsection demonstrates how to convert the output of the infrared sensor into a measurement of distance. The second subsection introduces the Robot Operating System, or ROS, which will allow the drone to share the distance measurement from the infrared sensor with other programs running on the Pi that make the drone fly.
